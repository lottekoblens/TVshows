## Architectural decisions

### React
**Why did I chose to work with React?** 

I have little experience with React. 

**Why did I chose to work with Functional components?**

There are multiple reasons why I chose for the use of Functional components. 
1. When I first worked with React for a project of school, they learned us using Functional components. So I'm used to that way of writing the code in React.
2. Functional components are easier to read and test, because they are plain JavaScript functions.
3. When you use Functional components you end up with less code then when you use Class components.
