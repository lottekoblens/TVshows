## Architectural decisions

### React
**Why did I chose to work with React?** 

Before this assignment I had a little experience with React and wanted to know more about this library. I wanted to challenge myself and therefore I chose to work with the framework React.

**Why did I chose to work with Functional components?**

There are some reasons why I chose for the use of Functional components. 
1. When I first worked with React for a project of school, they learned us using Functional components. So I'm used to that way of writing the code in React.
2. In my opinion, Functional components are easier to read, because it looks more like plain JavaScript functions.

### Sass

**Why did I chose Sass?**

I chose Sass because it keeps the code base smaller and it's easier to make changes to code that's written with Sass then with normal CSS.

## Unit testing

Before this assignment I never performed unit tests. I did try to implement the unit tests and eventually I got it to work. I think they could be performed  better, but for the first time writing unit tests I think it is a good start. Unfortunately I was not able to write unit tests for all files.
